<p> Meet the Officers of NHS TSA!<P>
  <p> Raka: President <p>
    <p>Raka, a junior at NHS, has a strong passion for engineering. She wants to go into biomedical engineering, and you can see that when you look at her biotechnology design portfolio. She enjoys being in TSA because
    she believes that TSA is a great opportunity to meet and network with students with interests in the same field.<p>
  <p>James: Vice-President<p>
    <p> James is a junior at NHS and knows how to get tasks done. He is the one we go to when we want to clarify something about registration or rules. He is very precise, and that is shown in his engineering interest of CAD
      where he uses this precision in order to make accurate CAD drawings.
  <p>Maaher: Secretary <p>
    <p> Maaher is a sophomore at NHS and is the co-founder of the VEX Robotics team with Jeffrey, a team that was created due to TSA. He enjoys working on all aspects of engineering, and enjoys lots of technology related tasks.
      Additionally, he also is the resource manager of the VEX Robotics team, making sure the team has enough resources than they did at the beginning of the year, a closet full of outdated parts and sensors.
      His passion for technology causes him to integrate technology and engineering together, like programming the VEX robot, and being in charge of photography.<p>
  <p>Jeffrey: Treasurer <p>
    <p>Jeffrey is a sophomore at NHS and is the co-founder of the VEX Robotics team with Maaher. He is the driver and has a passion when it comes to engineering, especially robotics.
  You can find him practicing driving 4 days a week after school, building and coming up with innovative ideas on improvement, and if you ever visit his living room, all you will find is VEX parts and a determined human. <p>
